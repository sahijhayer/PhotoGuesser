This app was designed using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Google Maps API, Node.js, express.js, EJS, and MongoDB. The front-end of the app was designed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with the Google Maps API used in the Javascript and EJS being used as the templating language. The random images and their locations were found using Node.js and express.js. Each user's past and current games were stored on a MongoDB Atlas database using express.js.
